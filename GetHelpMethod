The BEST way to get detailed Method/Module information is to ask the robot. Connect via SSH (the default username and password are both nao) and run the command (without quotes) "qicli info" to get a list of running methods. 
Then you can run that command for each method to get the list of modules within that method.
So for example you could enter qicli info ALMemory to see all the modules running in ALMemory.

You can call methods using "qicli call" like qicli call ALMotion.setAngles RShoulderPitch 0.7 0.2  which would rotate the right shoulder pitch motor to 0.7 radians at 20% of its maximum speed. 

For help with syntax the methods, most modules include a method called "getMethodHelp" so you would use the command: qicli call ALMotion.getMethodHelp setAngles
