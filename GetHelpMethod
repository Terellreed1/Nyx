You can call methods using "qicli call" like qicli call ALMotion.setAngles RShoulderPitch 0.7 0.2  which would rotate the right shoulder pitch motor to 0.7 radians at 20% of its maximum speed. 

For help with syntax the methods, most modules include a method called "getMethodHelp" so you would use the command: qicli call ALMotion.getMethodHelp setAngles
